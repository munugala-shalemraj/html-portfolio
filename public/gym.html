<h1>About My Gymlife</h1>
<p>As we all know that health is the most Important thing in our Life, taking care of our diet and Body could also define as a responsible person. 
Fitness cant be achieved by Money or Talent it requuires Hardwork, Consistency, Patient and a Unique Mindset with Determination. Many people will
join in the gym but they won't  gain Fitness, being fit is not only about going to gym and building muscles, you can also
do Yoga, calisthetics, Strength training, karate etc.All these Disciplinaries only teach about Hardwork and Discipline. It has been around a  
year of me joining in the gym and now i can personally give you the tips to how to build your muscle.     </p>

it is not easy as well as it is not hard it all depends on your mindset. Be flexible and Active in all the works you do   </p>
